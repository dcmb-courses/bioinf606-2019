# Day 5.  Unified Analytical Group Projects 
On the final day of this bootcamp, we will group up with the other
members of our table and embark on a joint effort to take what we have
learned this past week and use it to explore a large-scale biological
data set in a collaborative fashion. We will make use of the publicly
available digital expression matrix from single-cell RNA-seq of ~2,700 periphral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) produced by 10x genomics.
We will explore, pre-process, summarize, and visualize the dataset and
perform basic statistical analysis to identify cell-type-specific genes.

Typically, a research project can take a very long time to generate the data and analyze the results. For the purposes of this bootcamp, we will be using a small subset of these data and will attempt to recreate the published results over these regions. Our goal is to give you a taste of what types of data exploration are now available to you with the simple yet powerful biocomputing tools you have learned and to serve as a foundation for your future research endeavors.
